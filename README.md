# OkienkaTest project
Based on OkienkaTest app from [Dariusz Kluska](https://github.com/darkenk), this demo runs one application
per connected display. It also takes care of dispatching input events to the
proper activity.

The appplication use ActivityView for embedding multiple activities inside
one application. This allow to create multiwindow solutions for Android.

On the hardware side, it is using a [Nitrogen6x](http://boundarydevices.com/product/nitrogen6x-board-imx6-arm-cortex-a9-sbc/) along with two 7" displays
([LVDS Hannstar](http://boundarydevices.com/product/bd070lcc1-7-1280x800-display) and [RGB Okaya](http://boundarydevices.com/product/7-800x480-display))
